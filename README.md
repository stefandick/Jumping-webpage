Jumping-webpage
===============

Files from my created website employing a number of concepts.

In this page I used Java, CSS, and Javascript. In order to create the banner I 
used the image manipulation software GIMP. 

The javascript is used in the background to calculate the a persons athletic
ability in a chosen event and produce an appropiate response.

Tables, an image background, contrast, dropdown menus and lists are among the 
tools used.
